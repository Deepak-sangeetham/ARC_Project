# Abstract

  <p>Robotic manipulators usually exhibit time-varying, nonlinear, and coupled dynamics due to the parameter perturbations, disturbances, and other uncertainties. Traditional control algorithms typically do not possess parameters self-adaptive learning ability, limiting the tracking performance of the robot. To overcome this <b>{Adaptive Sliding mode control (ASMC)}</b> can be used.</p>
  <p>  Adaptive Sliding mode control is Well known as a robust control for nonlinear systems to deal with uncertainities. The principle of SMC is based on discontinuous control to force the control system's error state variable toward zero. Additionally, there are adaptive laws for the robust gain in the SMC to deal with the unknown external disturbance and reduce the chattering effect in the systems.</p>
